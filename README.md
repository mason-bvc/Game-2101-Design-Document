## What People Value in this Genre

Because the progression of the avatar is so closely linked with the progression of the player, there seems to be an even more meaningful connection with the avatar and game world compared to some other games or genres. There's also usually a greater emphasis on story. The format and pacing of the game allows more breathing room for the story to unfold. Resource management and strategic, non-realtime battle systems also seem to be attune to particular players' sensibility.

## Game Examples:

The Good: _Final Fantasy VII_
- Memorable cast, high-stakes active battle system, meaningful and impactful cinematics.

The Bad: _Hoshi wo Miru Hito_

- Frustrating, seemingly arbitrary battle system, early game is unreasonably difficult, cryptic puzzle design and progression.
